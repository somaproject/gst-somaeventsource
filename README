For the time being this is just notes:

SETUP
------------------------------------------------------------
Once you've build the plugin, you need to make sure that you
can find it. I've been avoiding a global install by explicitly
setting my GST_PLUGIN_PATH like so: 

GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/home/jonas/soma/gsteventsrc/trunk/src/.libs

You can then test if you can find the element via

gst-inspect-0.10 somaeventsource

and see something like: 


[jonas@hamiltonian trunk]$ gst-inspect-0.10 somaeventsource
Factory Details:
  Long name:    Soma Event Source
  Class:        Source/Soma/Event
  Description:  A clock-synchronous element providing Events off the network from Soma
  Author(s):    Eric Jonas <jonas@mit.edu>
  Rank:         none (0)

...


This should describe the pads, caps, etc. 

as a test pipeline, you can try


GST_DEBUG=1,somaeventsource:5 gst-launch-0.10 somaeventsource ! filesink location=/tmp/test.dat

which will dump received events to /tmp/test.dat (with all debugging turned on)

To only filter on a certain event, use the caps filter: 

gst-launch-0.10 somaeventsource ! soma/event,src=1 ! filesink location=/tmp/test.dat

which will only receive events from event src 1. Given that, for example, 
soma-netbench-tx doesn't send anything on event src 1, the above should
produce an emtpy buffer.
